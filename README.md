# Szechuan Sauce

## Overview
"The Stolen Szechuan Sauce" is a lab created by James at 'DFIR Madness'. It contains a collection of packet captures, Windows registry hives, and disk images that one must analyze to uncover an attack on a small company network. The full scenario, along with the associated files, can be found here: https://dfirmadness.com/the-stolen-szechuan-sauce/. 

## Skills Displayed
To piece together the attack I had to make use of three tools: Registry Explorer, for analyzing the provided hives; Autopsy, for analyzing and viewing the contents of the disk images; and Wireshark, for analyzing the provided packet capture. The most valuable thing I learned while completing this process was how to navigate the Windows file system and registry to find important forensic information: file access dates, login attempts, file modification, and much more had to be discovered in order to piece together the attack. These skills are valuable as Windows can be far from intuitive at times and I developed a much better idea of how and where it decides to store things.

## Things to Add
I would like to reformat this project to HTML so I can add it to my website properly.
